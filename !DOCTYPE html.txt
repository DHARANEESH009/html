 A natural disaster is "the negative impact following an actual occurrence of natural hazard in the event that it significantly harms a community".[1] A natural disaster can cause loss of life or damage property,[2] and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake. The severity of the damage depends on the affected population's resilience and on the infrastructure available.[3] Examples of natural hazards include: avalanche, coastal flooding, cold wave, drought, earthquake, hail, heat wave, hurricane (tropical cyclone), ice storm, landslide, lightning, riverine flooding, strong wind, tornado, typhoon, tsunami, volcanic activity, wildfire, winter weather.[1]
